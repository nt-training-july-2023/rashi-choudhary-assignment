Types of Streams:

Depending on the type of operations, streams can be divided into two primary classes:
Input Stream: These streams are used to read data that must be taken as an input from a source array or file or any peripheral device. For eg., FileInputStream, BufferedInputStream, ByteArrayInputStream etc.
Output Stream: These streams are used to write data as outputs into an array or file or any output peripheral device. For eg., FileOutputStream, BufferedOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream etc.
Depending on the types of file, Streams can be divided into two primary classes which can be further divided into other classes as can be seen through the diagram below followed by the explanations.
ByteStream: This is used to process data byte by byte (8 bits). Though it has many classes, the FileInputStream and the FileOutputStream are the most popular ones. The FileInputStream is used to read from the source and FileOutputStream is used to write to the destination. Here is the list of various ByteStream Classes:
